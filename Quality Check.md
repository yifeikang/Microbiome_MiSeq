Inside src/ folder, store fastqc.sh file and sample name file "basenames-295-full.txt", note here 295 is the total number of samples in the file

- Notice that the name in the basenames files has to be unique if using wild-card such as _ or ?.
  For instance, if you have animal ID 1-1 and you use 1-1_, it will get 1-1, and 1-10, 1-11, etc

fastqc.sh

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -N 1
#SBATCH -n 12
#SBATCH --mail-user=yifeik3@illinois.edu
#SBATCH --mail-type=END,FAIL
#SBATCH -J raw-fastqc

## MAKE SURE TO REPLACE THE 'X's ABOVE WITH YOUR INFORMATION (there are two places to do this)

cd ..

#Load the program needed; name may change in future so check each time with 'module avail FastQC'
# on command line
module load FastQC/0.11.8-Java-1.8.0_152

#Set up variable to pull base file names and make output directory
line=$(sed -n -e "$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID p" basenames-295-full.txt)

#Can use echo statements to put into .out files to help check on progress and diagnose
# locations of problems
echo "starting fastqc"
#fastqc -o ../results/fastqc/ ../data/raw-seq/fecal-dataset/${line}R?.fastq
fastqc -o ../results/fastqc/ ../data/raw-seq/fecal-dataset/${line}R1.fastq ../data/raw-seq/fecal-dataset/${line}R2.fastq
echo "fastqc finished"

```

```
#SBATCH --array=1-295%5
```

Here %5 means run 5 job at a time from the 295 jobs

```
#SBATCH -D /home/n-z/yifeik3/Ynsect2021_R/Ynsect-Fecal-microbial-2021/src/slurm-out
```

-D to set the direcotry for the slurm out files. Notice there is a `cd ..` command to move to back to the src/ folder since the direcotry is set to be /slurm.out

-Fastqc itself can actually be given multiple fastq files and you could run it as a single job without using a job array (#SBATCH â€“array line in fastqc.sh) or setting up a line variable by doing:

`fastqc -o ../results/fastqc/ ../data/raw-seq/fecal-dataset/*.fastq`

However, this will run each of the 295 \* 2 = 590 fastq files sequentially instead of in parallel. You also will need to pull each pair of samples using the line variable in other scripts. So here is what I suggest doing: take the full name of just the R1.fastq files and put them into a basenames file, then remove the R1.fastq part. Codes for this are:

```
cd /home/n-z/yifeik3/Ynsect2021_R/Ynsect-Fecal-microbial-2021/data/raw-seq/fecal-dataset/
ls *R1.fastq > ../../../src/basenames-295-full.txt
cd ../../../src/
sed -i 's/R1.fastq//' basenames-295-full.txt
```
